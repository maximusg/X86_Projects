X_86_Projects

All projects should be able be ran on an 64 bit linux platform. I specifically used Ubuntu for building and solving all problems.

Files are self-contained x86-64 projects from CS 3200 at NPS which are miticulously commented to demonstrate various assembly level programming techniques and hopefully understand from each comment what actions are being used for, projects will overview write/print to/from terminal to include reading/writing utilizing I/O for files, how to create functions, a simple netcat probram, and a heap traversal deomonstration.

All solutions to problems oulined in assigment pdfs are my own, and have potential improvement.
